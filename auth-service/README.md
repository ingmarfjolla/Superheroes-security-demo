# Introduction
This is the Auth Microservice. It is a reactive HTTP microservice exposing an API for performing authentication with WebAuthn, and
fine-grained authorization(relationship based access control) with OpenFGA. This also delegates the management of the 
database credentials using HashiCorp Vault. 

Users and their corresponding credentials are stored in a PostgreSQL database, but there is currently no exposed endpoints to do anything 
else with the users besides registering and logging in. 

Permission checks are done using OpenFGA with the Quarkus OpenFGA client. Currently, this service just uses the in memory data store that the
OpenFGA container provides. 

Database credentials are fully managed by HashiCorp Vault using the Quarkus Vault extension. This service makes use of dynamic database credential
creation, which only gives the application credentials for a specific amount of time.  

Currently the only tested version can run locally with Quarkus dev as seen below. 


This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/code-with-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.
